## Todo
### **Everything**

Specifically
- ~~add Collision detection to the right and left side of the arena,
so the blocks wont go off screen.~~

 - ~~rotating blocks, make sure block can't rotate off screen~~

 - ~~add score maybe~~

 - ~~and other blocks + colors~~

### OK that's done lets work on this 

 - ~~read more to add multiplayer(hopefully)~~

 - maybe sound cues

 - Combos

  &

 - ULLLLTRAAAAAAAA COMBOOOOOOOO!
